The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.

It seems your kid is having viral diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea.

Thank you.  doctor: Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive.  Medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect. So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication.  The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects.

My mum said she feel like a needle is poking on the back of her head. she cough alot and sometimes coughs up little blood. She also suffers from headache and her neck hurts when she gulps or swallows anything and literally cannot speak properly. the left side of her eye is red and tears keeps on falling, but is normal on the right side. When it is day she seems roughly OK and the symptoms usually happens on night.  doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. She is having chronic cough with hemoptysis (blood in sputum). And these symptoms are commonly seen with 1. Bronchitis 2. Lung infection 3. Lung cancer. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PUT (pulmonary function test) for the diagnosis of bronchitis. 3. Chest x-ray to rule out lung infection and lung cancer. She mayor need antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Don't worry, she will be alright with all these.

Viral bronchitis is more common than bacterial bronchitis. These infections may be associated with additional symptoms such as headaches, fatigue. Additional symptoms such as ear ache, sore throat, decreased appetite. You may want to consider the use of bucolic agents. These would help to reduce the thickness of the secretions so that it can be expelled easier. Examples are bipolar, guaifenesin, Mucomyst use of an analgesic would help with the headache.

With the available described symptoms, you are most likely suffering from acute upper respiratory tract viral infection with involvement of gastrointestinal tract causing nausea and vomiting. You should consult with internal medicine specialist and should go for thorough check up. You should go for complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, chest x-ray, renal function test and serum electrolytes. Furthermore, you should take complete antibiotic therapy, antispasmodics, probiotics, decongestants and cough suppressants. Furthermore, you should also take antiemetic such as metoclopramide and risperidone. You should maintain your HY Chat Doctor.

If not replenished, the cellular ATP supply would be depleted in most cells in less than 1 minute. Thus, ATP must be continuously synthesized. This in turn requires a steady supply of cellular fuels. However, the cellular fuels (e.g., glucose, fatty acids, and ketoacids) are present in the blood at levels that can support cellular metabolism only for a few minutes. The blood levels of these cellular fuels are maintained through the ingestion of precursors (i.e., carbohydrates, proteins, and fats). In addition, these fuels can be stored and then mobilized when ingestion of the precursors is not possible. The storage forms of these fuels are triglycerides (stored in adipose tissue), glycogen (stored in the liver and skeletal muscle), and protein.

In normal conditions, for any given level of a demand for oxygen, the myocardium will control the supply of oxygen-rich blood to prevent under-perfusion of myocytes and the subsequent development of ischemia and infarction. The major determinants of myocardial oxygen demand (MVO2) are heart rate, myocardial contractility, and myocardial wall tension (stress). An adequate supply of oxygen to the myocardium requires a satisfactory level of oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (determined by the inspired level of oxygen, pulmonary function, and hemoglobin concentration and function) and an adequate level of coronary blood flow.
